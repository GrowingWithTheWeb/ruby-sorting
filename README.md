# ruby-sorting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gwtw/ruby-sorting.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gwtw/ruby-sorting)

A collection of sorting algorithms written in Ruby.

Detailed information on the complexity of each algorithm is located [here][complexity_readme]. To learn more about how some of the algorithms are implemented, have a look at the [technical articles on my blog][gwtw_sorting].



## Installing

```bash
bundle install
```


## Generating documentation

```bash
rdoc
```



## Running tests

```bash
rake
```



## Contributing

I'd love to get some contributions for other sorting algorithms, if you want to make a pull request try to follow the existing style of the code and make sure you add tests for the new algorithm.
